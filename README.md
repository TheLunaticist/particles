Your tools are towers and a few buildings.
## TODO
refactor gui system (window manager class, window instances, etc)
introduce meta-progression
tower type ideas:
money maker (invest for later profit)
laser turret (aoe turret with slow moving laser beam)
melee tower (generate damage points which are spent to damage enemies on contact)
