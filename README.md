# Particles
Particles is a 2D tower defense game. Your goal is it to defend a newly established colony from the agressive locals.
Decide on the right stratergy to kill them all.
## TODO
- refactor gui system (window manager class, window instances, etc)
- introduce meta-progression
- tower type ideas:
  - money maker (invest for later profit)
  - laser turret (aoe turret with slow moving laser beam)
  - melee tower (generate damage points which are spent to damage enemies on contact)
- proper error screen
